# FirstTechChallenge iOS APP
The FIRST Tech Challenge is an annual robotics competition for students in years 6-12. Run internationally from September to April, teams compete to build robots to perform a series of challenges, the rules of which change each year. They generally compete head-to-head on a 12" by 12" playing field, but with the emergence of COVID they also run "at home" competitions, where the teams compete virtually. When officially competing, teams use the official scoring system - when competing "at home" that involves an online scoring app that is accessed through their browsers, and when at face-to-face competitions teams use a complex dedicated system. As part of the building process, teams run practice matches either as individual robots or against other teams. In these cases they need to keep score, but the official scoring apps are not an option. Many teams have taken to producing scoring apps, but these apps tend not to be very good, with limited functionality, mistakes in scoring, and poor design. Our goal is to build an app that is worth using.
